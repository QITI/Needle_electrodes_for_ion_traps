year={2006},

volume={12},
number={1},
pages={81-84},
abstract={To fabricate a probe needle, a tubular cathode was applied by electrochemical etching. A tungsten wire was used as an anode, and a stainless steel tube was used as a cathode, respectively. The stainless steel tube was partially immersed into a sodium hydroxide solution. After the tungsten wire was aligned at the center of the stainless steel tube, electricity was supplied from an external power source. During the experiment, the level of solution that was inside the stainless steel tube rose higher than that of the outer solution of the stainless steel tube, due to bubbles generated on the inner surface of the stainless steel tube, and the inner solution increased in volume. Using this process, the length of the probe needle tapering could be controlled without using a vertical loading system or controller.},

Classroom-tested programming exercises and review questions are also supplied at the end of each chapter. Features: provides an introduction to the basic notation and mathematical concepts for describing an image and the key concepts for mapping an image into an image; explains the topologic and geometric basics for analysing image regions and distributions of image values and discusses identifying patterns in an image; introduces optic flow for representing dense motion and various topics in sparse motion analysis; describes special approaches for image binarization and segmentation of still images or video frames; examines the basic components of a computer vision system; reviews different techniques for vision-based 3D shape reconstruction; includes a discussion of stereo matchers and the phase-congruency model for image features; presents an introduction into classification and learning.}
